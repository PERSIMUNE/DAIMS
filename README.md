Despite progress in data engineering, inconsistencies in data validation and documentation procedures continue to cause confusion and technical challenges in research involving machine learning (ML). While frameworks like **Datasheets for Datasets** have made strides in addressing these challenges, there is room for improvement to better prepare datasets for ML pipelines.  

To bridge this gap, we introduce **DAIMS**: Datasheets for AI and Medical Datasets. DAIMS extends the foundational framework with additional tools and guidance tailored specifically for medical datasets and AI applications.  

## Key Features  

1. **Comprehensive Checklist**  
   A 24-point checklist that covers common data standardization requirements. A subset of these checks is automated by the DAIMS software tool to validate dataset readiness.  

2. **Data Documentation Form**  
   An extended documentation form designed to capture essential metadata, pose relevant research questions, and ensure datasets are well-prepared for ML analysis.  

3. **Data Dictionary Table**  
   A tabular format to document variable descriptions, data types, units, and any relevant details about the dataset.  

4. **Flowchart for ML Analyses**  
   A guided flowchart that maps research questions to suggested ML methods, providing researchers with a clear pathway to address their objectives.  

5. **Software Tool**  
   A publicly available tool to assist in dataset preparation by automating key aspects of the checklist validation process.  

6. **Online App**  
   DAIMS is available as an easy-to-use online app hosted at [https://daims-app.streamlit.app/](https://daims-app.streamlit.app/), enabling efficient dataset evaluation and preparation.  

## Benefits of DAIMS  

- **Standardization**: Promotes consistent practices for preparing datasets in medical research.  
- **Guidance**: Offers actionable insights through the flowchart and checklist, helping researchers align datasets with their ML objectives.  
- **Automation**: Saves time by automating key validation processes.  
- **Documentation**: Enhances transparency and reproducibility through detailed data documentation.
